This is the output of the program

We can observe that the global lock method only method takes the least time since it's only one lock & unlock.

The second method is the least optimized since it applies the first method pretty much at every iteration.

The third method combines the best of both worlds, effectiveness and time complexity since it gives each coin a lock.
