Problem:
    The problem here was that the program tried to access splitv[j],
    which at the end of each poniter vector was NULL, so it would
    just crash with segmentation fault.

    Solution:
    I fixed it by adding a vector f, which stores the number of 
    words per pointer vector so it wouldn't come to try to access 
    the NULL values.
